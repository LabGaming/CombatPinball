## Description: 

A classic pinball clone, but with a little changes. a pinball is a mechanical game, there you can have some of the video game properties and i decide to add some one. ej: enemies and characters, particles, teleportation and little tricks of re usability and i decide to change the rules of the game, in a pinball you lost when the ball come down, now you lost when your character dies, because your character go to block the ball to go down, when the character dies? when the enemies make damage with some powers like the classics rpg games. meanwhile you need to have some information of the game, for that we need to create some dialog system, so the characters can communicate what happens all the time, things like damage and missions or something

## Steps: 

##### The first is the common step to all the Labs Project, this is for all can work together

1. New Unity Project with a new Scene and commit it on a gitHub public repository. You need make changes in Unity before upload the project (http://i.imgur.com/b0E18sR.png go to the menu Edit > Project Settings and change "version control" to "visible meta data" and "asset serializaion" to force text). Also, create a gitignore where you only upload in the repository the follow folders: Assets, Library and Project Settings.

2. Create the Table and some obstacle of the classic pinball machine like the bumpers, the ball have to respect some physical laws to simulate a real machine.

3. We can customize the table to simulate an scenery of a classic RPG Game like a castle or a forest

4. We have need to be able the user to move the pedals of the tables (right and left) using the keyboard and shot the ball when is in the starter point

5. Make some enemies and their AIs, only a simple AI like move to one side to another and attacks the characters. they need to have life points, this points have to be decreased when the enemies or characters are hit

6. Make the user able to having points and mission

7. Make Some lvls and a Story

8. Open to suggestions, this is the last step, but we can decide to extends if in the future we found some new features
